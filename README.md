# HTML-And-CSS-Template-3
HTML And CSS Design number Three

This design is taken from the educational courses of programmer Oussama Al-Zero, owner of the YouTube channel (ŸèElzero Web School). If I applied the design myself and found some difficulties in the project sections, I used it. This applied project taught me useful skills, especially with animation.
